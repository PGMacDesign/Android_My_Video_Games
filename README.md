This is an app that will allow you to add your favorite video games to it, rate them, and keep them for future reminiscing. 
Also, it will send the game you chose to a server (http://www.giantbomb.com/api/) and return data from it. It will then use that data to update a database and allow users to read descriptions of the game, see images, and read other interesting data. 
Users can also delete records from the list if they do not want them there.
